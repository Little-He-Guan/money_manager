/*
* For users, a test case is a void function that takes a reference of test_case_info.
* The user puts the code that will be executed in the test case in it, and makes assertions by the following 3 macros.
* 
* The parameter the function takes is used to record the info for the case (e.g. is it successful)
* 
* The user must ensure that 
* 1. the function is independent of other test cases (i.e. its result is not influenced by other test cases in any way)
* 2. the function is consistent (i.e. all calls to it give the same info)
* 
* The function should be defined by DEFINE_TEST_CASE and ENDDEF_TEST_CASE macros, and may be declared by DECLARE_TEST_CASE macro
* 
* In addition, users can define a test case template that is used to test different derived classes from a common super class with their mutual methods (member functions)
* inside the definition, the users should use INTERFACE to refer to the type of a derived class of the interface
* (the test case template is but a template function, and INTERFACE is its template parameter)
